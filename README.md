### What I learned

I got a little lost and confused when it came to dimesions so i did a little bit of fiddling to get a closet match.

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="card2">
      <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" class="image" />
    </div>
    <p class="text">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
    <p class="text2">
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
      the next level
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
